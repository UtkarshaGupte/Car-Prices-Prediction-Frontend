# Backend Service

The frontend application communicates with the backend service, which performs the car price prediction. The backend service is developed using FastAPI and Python. You can find the backend service code https://github.com/UtkarshaGupte/Car-Prices-Prediction-Backend .

Make sure the backend service is running on http://localhost:8000 or update the API endpoint URL in the frontend code (App.js) to match the backend service location.
